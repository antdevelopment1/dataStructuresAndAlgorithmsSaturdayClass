// Create a function called anagram that expects a string

    // Split the incoming string into an array
    
    // Save the middle value as the array length divived by 2 giving us the approximate middle of the array
    
    // We slice everything from the beginging of the array up until the value of the middle variable but not
    // including the middle value
    
    // We slice everything from the middle to the end of the array and save it to our second variable
    
    // We create a count and set it equal to 0

    // // Checks if the length of the string even or odd
  
        // If it is an odd length we return -1
 

    // Create an empty object

    // // Loops through the first word to check if each character is in the object
    
        // If it is we increment it plus 1
        
        // Otherwise we set it equal to 1
       

    // // Loops through the second word in the string and checks if that is in the string. If it is we subtract 1
    // // If it isnt we we do nothing only because of the nature of this problem. For a traditional anagram solution
    // // We would return false because not find the letter in the first world mean the two words dont match and are not anagrams
    // // of one another. But this problem asks us to return the value of changed letters needed to make the two words 
    // // anagrams of one another.
    
        // If we cannot find that letter in our object we do nothing
       
        // If we can find the letter in our object we will subtract 1 from the object
           

    // // We loop through the object after we decrement from it the found letter. The remain vlaues of the keys
    // // are the number of changes that will need to be made and we accumulate the total into a varable and return the value
    
        // Accumalate all the keys values into count since this number should represent the difference
        // in characters in our first string vs our second string and store the sum in count
        
   
    // // We return the count for the number of different characters that will be needed to get them to anagrams of each other
